title: "Recurrent neural networks"
start: 540
teaching: 60
exercises: 30
questions:
- "Key question (FIXME)"
objectives:
- "First learning objective. (FIXME)"
keypoints:
- "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is an artificial neural network characterized by a dual direction of the flow of information between its layers."
- "RNNs allows the output from some nodes to affect subsequent input to the same nodes. The ability to use an internal state (memory) make this kind of NN particularly useful to process arbitrary sequences of inputs like time series"
